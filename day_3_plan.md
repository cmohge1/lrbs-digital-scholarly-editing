## Synopsis

Today will examine eclectic text editing and learn more about TEI.

## Aims

- An understanding of what makes an eclectic text, and how it fits into editorial tradition.
- The ability to create and encode an *apparatus criticus*.
- A set of principles for annotating scholarly editions.

### Seminar 6: Eclectic/clear text Editing

### Readings

1. W. W. Greg, "The Rationale of Copy Text"
2. Fredson Bowers, "Some Principles..."
3. Tanselle, "Varieties of Scholarly Editing".
4. Parker, *Flawed Texts and Verbal Icons*.

#### Lecture Notes

What is the copy-text? The Greg-Bowers method.

Authorial intention. The goal with so-called "copy-text" editing is to reconstruct the text that comes closest to the author's final intentions.

This comes out of two general scenarios:

1. We have an autograph manuscript and a later printing of the work.
2. We do not have a manuscript but we have multiple versions of the printed work.

In either scenario, the editor choses as "copy text" the earliest version, or (in some rare cases) some other version that appears to be closest to the author's final intentions (see Stephen Crane's *Red Badge of Courage* as an example of that rare case).

*Substantives* versus *accidentals*: the editor is advised to select *substantive* (meaningful words) readings from the first or most authoritative printing and the *accidentals* (punctuation, spelling, capitalisation) from the manuscript or first printed source.

What did Greg actually argue? <!-- insert quotes -->

It's important to stress that Greg's ideas came out of the context of Renaissance literature, which presents a textual situation that is unique from, and requires different treatment than, more recent literature (i.e., from the nineteenth and twentieth century).

Example 1: Shakespeare: *King Lear* and *Othello*. See Greg, from *Editorial Problems in Shakespeare* and [Vickers](https://www.the-tls.co.uk/articles/public/norton-new-oxford-shakespeare/).

Example 2: Milton. See [Gaskell on *Comus*](../readings/Gaskell_on_Milton.pdf) and Empson on Bentley's editing of Milton.

Example 3: Dickens's *David Copperfield*. [See Gaskell on Dickens](../readings/Gaskell_on_Dickens.pdf).

Example 4: [Mark Twain's *Adventures of Huckleberry Finn*](http://www.marktwainproject.org/xtf/view?docId=works/MTDP10000.xml;chunk.id=laf858;toc.depth=1;toc.id=la0854;citations=;style=work;brand=mtp#X).

### Seminar 8: Editing a clear text: stories and poems

#### Principles of Annotation

See [Empson on annotation](../readings/empson-obscurity-and-annotation.pdf).

Dr Johnson's maxim: to correct what is corrupt, and clarify what is obscure.

#### Writing and encoding annotation
