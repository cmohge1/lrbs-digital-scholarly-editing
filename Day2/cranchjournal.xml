                     at Edinburgh, Kinmont settled in 1828 in Cincinnati, where he directed an
                     academy and married Mary Eckstein, the daughter of a devout Swedenborgian. He
                     was best known for his <bibl><title>Twelve Lectures on the Natural History of
                           Man and the Rise and Progress of Philosophy</title> (Cincinnati,
                        1839)</bibl>, which embraced the theory of man's divine nature yet radically
                     suggested that educators ought to emphasize classical education (i.e. less
                     originality and more imitation of Greek and Latin masters) and natural science
                     instead of Biblical instruction. </note>

                  <note>Clarke was a cousin of Margaret Fuller. He befriended C. P. Cranch while at
                     Harvard Divinity School, from which he graduated in 1833. Soon afterward he was
                     installed in Louisville. He shared with Cranch an enthusiasm for Coleridge and
                     German literature, as well as the ideas of Emerson. With Ephraim Peabody,
                     Clarke founded the Unitarian literary magazine <title>The Western
                        Messenger</title>, and took over as editor in 1836. Like Cranch he saw that
                     Unitarianism would cease to be relevant unless Unitarian leadership learned to
                     re-organize church life to meet the changing demographic of western American
                     life. He would resign his puplit in Louisville in 1840 and move to
                     Boston.</note>

                     and installed at the Unitarian church in Cincinnati in 1835. A follower of
                     Charles Fourier's plans for social reorganization, Channing was one of the
                     first Christian socialists, eventually editing the <title>Present</title>, the
                        <title>Spirit of the Age</title> and the <title>Harbinger</title>. In 1848
                     he presided over The Religious Union of Associationists in Boston and

                     minister-in-training after finishing Harvard Divinity School in 1836, Dwight
                     eventually "became the gentle arbiter of America's taste in music" with his
                     starting <title>Dwight's Journal of Music</title> in 1852 (Miller 3). In
                     addition to responding eagerly to Ralph Waldo Emerson's non-conformist ethic
                     and neo-Platonic spirituality, he befriended George Ripley, minister of the
                     Purchase Street Church in Boston, who was one of Emerson's astute
                     Transcendentalist allies, and his wife Sophia Dana Ripley, who shared Dwight's
                     musical enthusiasm. He would play a major role in the Brook Farm
                     experiment.</note>

                     (1797&#8211;1841) and Georgiana Augusta (Wylie) Keats (1797&#8211;1879), and a
                     niece of John Keats. After immigrating to the United States from London in
                     1818, her parents settled in Louisville in late 1819 so that George could work
                     in the sawmill of Thomas W. Bakewell. From 1821 until his death, George ran a
                     literary salon in his living room to fill what he considered the cultural void
                     in Louisville. In 1847 Georgiana Emily married Alfred Gwathmey, and stayed in
                     Louisville until her death. See also <bibl>Gigante's <title>The Keats Brothers:

               could forgive the man of calculation his want of faith if he had knowledge of the

               Emerson's "General Views" lecture (from the 1837&#8211;38 "Human Culture" series):
               "Now what is true of a month's or a year's issue of new books, seems to me with a
               little qualification true of the age [. . .] One man, two men,&#8212;possibly, three
               or four,&#8212;have cast behind them the long-descended costume of the academy, and
               the expectations of fashion, and have said, This world is too fair, this world comes
               home too near to me than that I should walk a stranger in it, and live at

               Scholar" that significant truths derive not necessarily from books but from an
               engagement with nature&#8212;"instead of Man Thinking, we have the bookworm"

                  Resartus</title> to not know thyself, but "know what thou canst work at," Carlyle
               asks a rhetorical question: "Hast thou a certain Faculty, a certain Worth, such even
               as the most have not; or art thou the completest Dullard of these modern times? Alas,
               the fearful Unbelief is unbelief in yourself; and how could I believe?" (123). The
               "skepticism" recalls Carlyle's arguments against the "Age of Skepticism" induced by
               Voltaire, Hume, the French Revolution, materialism, and British Utilitarianism. In
               his "State of German Literature" essay, Carlyle suggests that German writers provide
               spiritual sustenance to people hampered by skepticism, which has made Europe "a scene
               blackened and burnt-up with fire; mourning in the darkness, because there is
               desolation, and no home for the soul" (<bibl><title>Critical and Miscellaneous

               which he warns of "profound unbelief,&#8212;a diffidence" resulting from the fact
               that "society sickens of skepticism" (<bibl><title>Early Lectures</title>,

            <note xml:id="note16">Leaving for Boston in 1838, Clarke had asked Cranch to take over
               as editor for at least two issues. When Clarke returned to Louisville in late
               December, he exalted in the "exquisite keenness of [Emerson's] intellect and antique
               charm of his imagination," resolving to stand behind "a man whose life is holiness,
               whose words are gems, whose character is of the purest type of heroism, yet of

            <note xml:id="note17">Cranch experienced the same problem the last time he was in
               Louisville, as is indicated in a November 21, 1838, letter to Clarke: "Our river is

            <note xml:id="note18"><hi rend="underline">natural</hi> and <hi rend="underline">free</hi>] Cranch echoes Emerson's saying in "Heroism" that "A great man scarcely
               knows how he dines, how he dresses; but without railing or precision, his living is
               natural and poetic." An early version of "Heroism" was delivered as a lecture in
               Boston in the winter of 1837, as part of his lectures on "Human Culture." See also
               the introduction to this edition for more on how the "natural and free" idea comes
               from Dwight's musical aesthetics.</note>

               Kant's categorical imperative but also the Calvinistic strains of Cranch's thought.
               As Miller suggests, Cranch was raised in a Puritan household, and <quote>"God's
                  immanence and man's duty to God were real truths for him"</quote>
                     (<bibl><title>Cranch and His Caricatures</title>, 10</bibl>). Cranch's lineage
               compares to Emerson, whose Aunt Mary was likewise puritanical in her many letters to

               ("Cranch's 'Journal,'" 148): "Cranch and I were so profane as to illustrate some of
               your sayings by sketches not of the gravest character. I should like to show them to
               you, for I think you would like them. . . . C. P. Cranch has quite a talent at drawing

               May 20, 1839, letter to Clarke, Cranch then commented on these drawings: "By the way,
               I lent [Furness] my Emersonian scraps to take on with him, and it seems by sundry
               external signs upon them since they were returned to me, that they have been
               considerably thumbed and pocketed. Great men have looked upon them. The genius of a
               Dewey and a Channing hath stopped to smile condescendingly on them. Our fame, friend,
               groweth. It hath been budding with the spring. We are linked in celebrity, and thus
               will descend to posterity as the immortal illustrators of the great
               Transcendentalist! When all trades fail, let us take to caricaturing. We have humors
               that way" (MHS typescript). See <ref type="html" target="2014/editions/cranchjournal_appendices">Appendix 1</ref> for a larger

            <note xml:id="note22">"swallows all formulas"] Cranch is most likely thinking of

                  Press, 2002], 188)</bibl>. Cranch had also probably read a related passage from
               Carlyle's <title>French Revolution</title>, vol. 2, book 3, chapter 7, "Death of
               Mirabeau" (1838): "So blazes out, far-seen, a Man's Life, and becomes ashes and a
               caput mortuum, in this World-Pyre, which we name French Revolution: not the first
               that consumed itself there; nor, by thousands and many millions, the last! A man who
               'had swallowed all formulas'; who, in these strange times and circumstances, felt
               called to live Titanically, and also to die so. As he, for his part, had swallowed
               all formulas, what Formula is there, never so comprehensive, that will express truly
               the plus and the minus of him, give us the accurate net-result of him? There is

            <note xml:id="note23">Compare Cranch's own words in "A Letter on Travelling," in the
               June 1838 <title>Messenger</title>: "Well, here I am&#8212;again a
               wanderer&#8212;another, and still another parting have I endured. For nearly three
               years it has been my lot to rove from place to place, North, South, East,
               West&#8212;making friends and parting from them&#8212;verily, I am growing aweary of
               such itinerant ways of living" (<bibl><title>Western Messenger</title> 5 [June 1838]:
                  183</bibl>). Emerson would later warn against the dangers of traveling in
               "Self-Reliance": "Travelling is a fool's paradise [. . .] The rage of travelling is a
               symptom of a deeper unsoundness affecting the whole intellectual action. The
               intellect is vagabond, and our system of education fosters restlessness. Our minds
               travel when our bodies are forced to stay at home" (<bibl><title>Collected Works of Ralph Waldo

               Press, 1980], 2:46&#8211;47</bibl>). That thought could have had its genesis in "The
               Individual," where he quotes the adage, "To know that the sky is everywhere blue, you
               need not travel round the world" and says, "I travel faster than you. In my closet I
               see more and anticipate all your wonders" (<title>Early Lectures</title>,

            <note xml:id="note24">compensation] Cranch anticipates Emerson's doctrine of
               compensation, that the world consists of <quote>"relations of parts and the end of

                  (<title>CW</title>, 1:29, 36). Cranch could also be thinking of Emerson's early
               lecture "On the Relation of Man to the Globe" (<title>Early Lectures</title>
               1:27&#8211;49), which set the groundwork for compensation as one of Emerson's
               fundamental ideas (even though the word "compensation" does not appear in the lecture
               and in <title>Nature</title>).</note>
            <note xml:id="note25">In a letter of February 9, 1839, Clarke also entertained doubts
               about "the expediency of my leaving Louisville," adding that "I have no such serious
               purpose, but at times I am 'exercised in mind' about the propriety of so doing. It
               often seems to me as if some one else could do more good than I here, and I do more
               good somewhere else. I am by no means a popular preacher in this place, nor ever
               shall be ... I am extremely anxious in this matter to be guided solely by duty ...
               William Channing urged me so strongly to retain the 'Western Messenger' that I have

               take it to Cincinnati. C. P. Cranch stayed three weeks with me after I reached home,

            <note xml:id="note26">On October 14, 1837, Cranch had written to his sister Margaret
               about Georgiana Emily: "I went the other night to see Mr. Keats, an English gentleman
               residing here, and brother to Keats, the poet. He seemed to be a very intelligent and
               gentlemanly man, and has some daughters, only one of whom I saw, a young lady about
               fourteen years apparently, with face and features strongly resembling Keats, the
               poet, or that little portrait of him which you see in the volume containing his poems
               in conjunction with Coleridge and Shelley. I could scarcely keep my eyes from her
               countenance, so striking was the likeness" (<bibl>Scott, <title>Life and

            <note xml:id="note27">Dialogic artistry was a crucial aspect of transcendentalism, due
               in large part to the salon-like conversation/debating clubs such as the Semi-Colon

            <note xml:id="note28">Semi-Colon was a primarily Unitarian conversation club consisting
               mostly of writers and intellectuals. The Beecher sisters were among its members, and
               the club played a part in launching the career of Harriet Beecher Stowe (see
                  <bibl>Forrest Wilson's <title>Crusader in Crinoline: A Life of Harriet Beecher
                     Stowe</title> [New York: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1941]</bibl>, 122&#8211;26).
               Semi-Colon provided intellectual stimulation for a small cohort of Boston-area
               transplants in a rugged frontier city. See <bibl>Louis Tucker, "The Semi-Colon Club
                  of Cincinnati," <title>Ohio History</title> 73, no. 1 (1964)</bibl>. For a recent
               essay on the Semi-Colon members, women writers, and its hostesses (including a
               section on Cranch's relation to club), see <bibl>Nicole Tonkovich's "Writing in
                  Circles," in <title>Nineteenth-Century Women Learn to Write</title>
                  (Charlottesville: University Press of Virginia, 1995), 149&#8211;78</bibl>. Cranch
               praised Semi-Colon for providing freedom for more advanced writers as well as
               "embolden[ing] beginners to a spontaneity of thought and style" (Library of Congress
               manuscript; quoted in Tonkovich, 152). Tonkovich also challenges the accuracy of
               Wilson's view on the club's responsibility for bolstering Stowe's career.</note>
            <note xml:id="note29">"Dreams" appeared in the <bibl><title>Western Messenger</title> 6
                  (June 1839): 98&#8211;100</bibl>. Of interest is his rhetorical question,

                  to the spirit's ear [. . .] ?"</quote> The "imprisoned spirit" looks to the
               Imagination for spiritual answers. This may have informed Cranch's poem "The Three
               Muses," in which he describes a bewildered traveler's waking dream, and a muse calls
               upon <quote>"the truth sublime" of "The soul within the soul, the hidden life, / The
                  fount of dreams, the vision and the strife / Of thoughts that seized on every

               were good, and the music refreshing; and dancing&#8212;heavens! how they danced. 'Old
               men and maidens gay', whose heads seemed almost topsyturveyed. It was one of the most
               delightful seasons of social refreshment I ever enjoyed. A perfect inundation of
               spirits, whose merry and sparkling utterances seemed to set afloat in mere
               kindliness, the most staid and old, who at first were prone to root themselves to the
               sides of the room in their chairs. 'Such music flows from kind hearts, in a kind
               environment of time and peace.' 'The poor claims of me and thee vanished.' We were
               all as one" (MHS typescript).</note>
            <note xml:id="note31">In an undated fragment of a journal or letter, Cranch expressed

               who took issue with his work at the <title>Western Messenger</title> (MHS
               typescript). He was also not afraid to poke at them: see his poem (signed "X") in the
               May 1838 (vol. 5) issue of the <title>Western Messenger</title>&#8212; <quote>"Surely
                  our preachers should have warmth of soul, / And yet we hear of Unitarian

               "Cranch's 'Journal,'" 148). His chief objective was "to form such connections with
               the poor as will enable us, in some degree at least, to withdraw them and their
               children from evil associations, and to combine immediate physical relief with

            <note xml:id="note33"><hi rend="underline">cement</hi>] Cranch may have recalled this
               metaphor from Emerson's 1833 lecture "The Uses of Natural History," in which he
               encourages strong minds to sympathize with all fellow beings: "Where is it these fair
               creatures (in whom an order and series is so distinctly discernable,) find their link,
               their cement, their keystone, but in the Mind of Man? It is he who marries the
               visible to the Invisible by uniting thought to Animal Organization" (<title>Early
                  Lectures</title>, 1:24). Also, he might be remembering a similar thought from
               "Water," in which Emerson speaks of the friend who "is present in every function of
               life, grows in the vegetable, is a cement, and an engineer, and an architect, in
               inanimate nature" (<title>Early Lectures</title>, 1:51).</note>
            <note xml:id="note34">On December 7, 1838, Thomas Butler fatally stabbed a clerk named
               James T. White with a Bowie knife in "a house of ill fame" in Cincinnati
                  (<title>Cincinnati Whig</title>, December 10, 1838). The <title>Whig</title>
               reported that "some disturbance took place in an upper room of the establishment,
               (but with which Mr. White had nothing to do,) which attracted the notice of Butler,
               who immediately started for the scene of the riot. In going up stairs, he met Mr.
               White coming down, and instantly gave him two fatal stabs in the region of the heart,
               and, (so far as is known,) without the slightest provocation. ... Butler made his
               escape." The mayor of Cincinnati offered a $250 reward for his capture. He was
               captured in late December and returned to his native city of Jeffersonville, Indiana,
               according to a Cincinnati correspondent's report in the January 3, 1839,
                  <title>Scioto Gazette</title> (Chillicothe, Ohio). Butler's trial ended on January
               22 with a guilty verdict of second-degree murder.</note>

               sundry external signs upon them since they were returned to me, that they have been
               considerably thumbed and pocketed. Great men have looked upon them. The genius of a
               Dewey and a Channing hath stopped to smile condescendingly on them. Our fame, friend,
               groweth. It hath been budding with the spring. We are linked in celebrity, and thus
               will descend to posterity as the immortal illustrators of the great
               Transcendentalist! When all trades fail, let us take to caricaturing. We have humors
               that way. I did not, by the way, hear the echo of your laugh over the last scraps I
               sent you from Washington. Pray tell me if you received them safe out of the vulgar
               hands of the men of the post office. I would not have these sacred mysteries bared to
               common daylight and to uninitiated and vulgar risibilities. Pray tell me that you
               received them. I heard in fancy your laugh for a week. Do write that laugh on paper,
               and send us a scrap of your own.</p>
            <p>O my brother, we need your poetic faculty to quicken us in this life. My wits have
               brought forth little but thorns and weeds since thy rain and sunshine were withdrawn.
               True, when I was at home, the quiet atmosphere of that loved spot, backed by the
               influences of the opening spring, and the bees and blossoms, did call forth some
               fruit&#8212;such as it was. And I did commence a Spenserian stanza poem which I shall
               probably never complete. I wrote near forty stanzas. It is a love tale, thus far. But
               I got dissatisfied with it. I followed my own experience too closely. Besides, it
               does not look ministerial. Should I publish, what would the world say, etc.,
               etc.&#8212;comes into my mind. What have I to do with writing and publishing such
               stuff?</p>
            <p>I perceive you are relieved of the immediate care of the "Messenger". I wish you joy.
               I hope Channing will not mix in too much abolitionism. Look out for southern
               subscribers, if you don't take care.</p>
            <p>I saw young Huidekoper a week ago, who was just about embarking for Europe. Chandler
               Robbins also I met in New York just before he sailed. I had a good time in New York
               at the dedication of Dewey's church. I don't like the name&#8212;do you? He preached
               a grand sermon though. And Fanny Parkman who seems to be midwife general to all the
               churches which are legitimate, made an excellent dedicatory prayer.</p>
            <p>But now, no more. Tempus est stopendi. Windum up est. Write to us if we have any
               place in your memory. Remember me to each and all of my good Louisville friends. I
               remember them all with interest.</p>
            <p>Ever your friend and brother, <lb/>C. P. C. </p>

            <note type="headnote"><hi rend="italic">At the end of his 21 June 1839 letter to his
                  brother from Philadelphia, Cranch said he was reading Hazlitt's "Spirit of the
                  Ages," "Specimens of Foreign Literature, being Eckermann's Conversations with
                  Goethe (translated by Miss Fuller), and Cousin, who "does much to strengthen my
                  faith." Furthermore, he added, "To show you how far he is, and I too, from
                  'Transcendentalism', I will scratch off a few lines I wrote yesterday while
                  reading him</hi>.</note>
