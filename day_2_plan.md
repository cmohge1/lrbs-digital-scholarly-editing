#### Seminar 3: Documentary Editing; Introduction to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)

#### Readings

1. G. Thomas Tanselle, ["The Editing of Historical Documents."](/readings/tanselle_editing_historical _documents.pdf)
2. Lou Burnard's [*What is the TEI?*](https://books.openedition.org/oep/426)
3. James Cummings, ["The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature"](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-6&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ss1-6-6&brand=9781405148641_brand)

To make a long article short: transcribe as much as possible.

Yet: one cannot transcribe everything. As soon as transcription happens, an element of contingency comes into the text.

### Seminar 4: TEI and ODD; TEI for Documentary Editing

ODD files (One Document Does it all) are TEI customisation files that serve as a source for the derivation of

* a formal TEI schema
* readable documentation of the project's TEI encoding choices

The TEI offers a web application called [Roma](http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/) to build ODDs.

The ODD validates the TEI document.
