2. Lou Burnard's [*What is the TEI?*](https://books.openedition.org/oep/426)
3. James Cummings, ["The Text Encoding Initiative and the Study of Literature"](http://www.digitalhumanities.org/companion/view?docId=blackwell/9781405148641/9781405148641.xml&chunk.id=ss1-6-6&toc.depth=1&toc.id=ss1-6-6&brand=9781405148641_brand)

#### Documentary Editing
To make a long article short: transcribe as much as possible.

Yet: one cannot transcribe everything. As soon as transcription happens, an element of contingency comes into the text.

[Example 1: Mark Twain's notebooks and journals. Access slides here.](/Day2/mark-twain-journals.pdf)

[Example 2: Christopher Cranch's 1834 travel journal](http://scholarlyediting.org/2014/editions/cranchjournal.html)

#### Introduction to the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)

#### Seminar 4

#### Text Modelling

"[E]very electronic representation of text is an interpretation" (Paul Eggert, *Securing the Past*, Cambridge UP, 2009).

And an argument, many say. Are these points obvious, or absurd?

Modelling: Our notions of modelling a text are really inherent in textual editing activities, but the theorising about modeling could point back to Willard McCarty's insistence on the centrality of modelling in digital humanities projects (see his *Humanities Computing*, Palgrave, 2005).

Patrick Sahle's model (of text modelling):

What do you think?

#### TEI and ODD; TEI for Documentary Editing

ODD files (One Document Does it all) are TEI customisation files that serve as a source for the derivation of

* a formal TEI schema
* readable documentation of the project's TEI encoding choices

The TEI offers a web application called [Roma](http://www.tei-c.org/Roma/) to build ODDs.

The ODD validates the TEI document.
